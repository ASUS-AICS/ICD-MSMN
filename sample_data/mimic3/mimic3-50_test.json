As noted above,\nshe has a history of worsening dyspnea over the past few months\nthat has been treated with antibiotics and steroids.  She\npresented to OSH on [**2111-6-3**] with worsening dyspnea and had a\nfever to 103F, and was started on ceftriaxone\/azithromycin\n([**Date range (1) 83455**]) for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.  She developed\nan increasing oxygen requirement, however, and initially\nrequired nasal canula (94% on 1 L O2) but later required face\nmask (86% on 15 L on [**6-7**]).  Her CXR, which initially was read\nas negative for infiltrate, progressively worsening, with\nincreasingly prominent diffuse bilateral infiltrates, right\ngreater than left.  She also had a negative chest CTA.  With an\noxygen requirement that was rising and worsening dyspnea, she\nwas transitioned to vanc\/zosyn\/levo and then vanc\/zosyn\/ceftaz\n([**Date range (1) 83456**]; ceftaz started [**6-8**]; levo on [**4-21**]) because of\nan allergy to levofloxacin.  It is unclear why she received\ndouble coverage for gram negatives.  She was also given\nmethylprednisolone ([**6-6**] dose 20 mg iv q8; then 80->60 mg iv q8\nafterward).\n.\nOn [**6-7**], she was admitted to the ICU and intubated electively\nfor hypoxia and SOB.  Sputum culture grew staph aureas that was\nMRSA per report.  Influenza viral screen was negative.\nPhenylephrine was started because of hypotension to SBPs in the\n80s after being intubated and starting on propofol ([**Date range (1) 83456**]),\nwhich had to be uptitrated for sedation.  She was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-9**] based on her family's wishes.\n.\nOn arrival, her ventilator settings were Vt 500cc, FiO2 100%,\nPEEP 16.

Her course was notable for\nprogressive worsening of her respiratory status during her OSH\nhospitalization, along with development of bilateral\ninfiltrates.  At the time of transfer, her CXR, large A-a\ngradient, and low PaO2\/FiO2 were thought to be consistent with\nARDS\/acute lung injury, and mechanical ventilation settings\ntargeted low tidal volumes and high respiratory rate.  However,\ndespite this, her lung was compliant, with low peak inspiratory\npressures.  She was also very PEEP dependent.  Culture data from\nthe OSH eventually demonstrated MRSA in her sputum culture and\nshe was initially managed with vancomycin\/zosyn and then zosyn\nwas discontinued, and she was given a course of solumedrol\nbecause of her history of question COPD.  A respiratory viral\nscreen performed at the OSH was negative and was repeated at\n[**Hospital1 18**]. The initial DFA test was negative but the sample was sent\nto the state lab and there, it was positive for H1N1.  The ID\nservice was consulted and recommended switching from vancomycin\nto linezolid and empirically completing a course of oseltamavir\nOf note, she also underwent a repeat chest CTA that was negative\nfor PE and a TTE with a bubble study that was limited in quality\nbut negative for intracardiac shunt. She continued to require\nhigh PEEP with hypoxia if PEEP was lower than 10. Diuresis was\ntried several times with minimal change in PEEP. Linezolid was\nswitched back to vancomycin given concern for lactic acidosis.\nID then recommended switching to meropenem to cover resistent\npseudomonal VAP which she continued for a 15 day course. A PICC\nline was placed on [**2111-6-25**] for long term antibiotics.\nOseltamivir was discontinued on [**6-25**]. Vanco was discontinued.\nGradually able to wean down PEEP with improvement in\nbronchospastic episodes on increased sedation, and a trach was\nplaced by IP on [**2111-6-30**]. Sedatives eventually weaned off on [**7-2**]\nand transitioned to fentanyl gtt and valium, which too were\nweaned off to a 25 mcg patch q72 hours - This should be weaned\nfurther at her facility under the direction of the accepting MD.\nPatient was transitioned to lasix IV boluses until Cr and BUN\nbumped, then PRN to keep her I\/Os even. Although sputum cx with\npersistence of pseudomonas, per ID this was thought to represent\ncolonization. Pt finished her 15 day course of meropenem on\n[**2111-7-7**].\n- Single lumen PICC was placed [**2111-7-6**] after a 3 day line\nholiday.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Patient developed AF with RVR and hypotension.\nCHADS score=2. No evidence of PE on CTA chest or right heart\nstrain on echo; normal atria. She was started on hep gtt and\namio-loaded. She remained in sinus rhythm for the majority of\nthe rest of her stay aside from one further bout of Afib.\nHeparin was discontinued at time of trach placement; long-term\nanticoagulation was not started as she is considered low-risk\ns\/p conversion. She was continued on amiodarone and ASA.\n\n# Volume overload: The patient was volume overloaded after about\n1 week in the ICU. Lasix gtt was started to have a smoother\ndiuresis as bolus doses (of 40mg IV lasix) made her transiently\nhypotensive. She was restarted on lasix gtt in setting of\npressors, which were eventually weaned off. She was then\ntransitioned to IV lasix boluses at 160mg IV tid until Cr and\nBUN bumped, then transitioned to PRN Lasix boluses to keep I\/Os\neven. Of note, she was on acetazolamide for a few days due to\nmetabolic alkosis but this was discontinued as bicarb\nnormalizing.\n- Please give IV lasix 80-160mg PRN to keep fluid balance even.\n\n# Fungemia: Patient began to spike fevers almost one month into\nher hospitalization. She was started on oral fluconazole on\n[**2111-7-2**] due to persistent yeast-positive urine cultures despite\nchanging out Foley catheters.  RIJ placed [**2111-6-20**] was pulled\n[**7-2**]. However, [**7-1**] blood cultures from a-line grew out yeast\n(presumptively not C. albicans) on [**7-3**]; her A-line and PICC\nwere pulled. ID was re-consulted and recommended switching to\nmicafungin. Ophthalmology was consulted and did not see evidence\nof endopthalmitis. TTE was suboptimal but without e\/o\nendocarditis; ID did not think TEE needed. As blood cx grew C.\nparaipsilosis, changed to fluconazole IV to complete 14-day\ncourse of antifungal (last dose [**2111-7-16**]). Repeat blood cultures\nincluding mycolytic cultures showed no growth to date up until\n[**2111-7-6**].\n\n# Left arm weakness: Patient was noted to be moving all\nextremities except the left upper voluntarily on [**2111-7-4**].\nConcern was for emoblic event given AF as well as fungemia. CT\nHead was done [**7-4**] which showed no acute process and a TTE was\nwithout vegitations. Pt later observed to be moving all 4\nextremities and withdrawing to painful stimuli in L arm so no\nfurther work-up pursued.\n\n# Vaginal Bleeding: She was noted to have vaginal bleeding after\na week in the hospital. She was evaluated by OB GYN who could\nnot find evidence of further bleeding. A pelvic ultrasound was a\nvery limited study but did not find any pathology. She should\nfollow up as an outpatient with her OB\/Gyn for further workup.\n\n# Hypertriglyceridemia: TG elevated to 303 in setting of\npropofol gtt. Pt initially switched to fentanyl and midazolam\nwith improvement in TG. She was changed back to propofol for\nvent weaning with continued improvement and subsequent\nnormalization of TG prior to discontinuation.\n\n# Atyical BAL pathology: Tissue from bronch done on [**5-31**] showed\natypical plasmacytoid immunoblasts with abnormal CD138+\/CD56+\ncell population on flow cytometry. Significance unclear in in\nthe context of an acute viral illness and a reactive process was\nfavored, although a lymphoproliferative disorder could not be\nruled out. Repeat bronch on [**6-17**] with path read of \"lymphocytes,\nalveolar macrophages, neutrophils and rare plasma cells with\ninsufficient tissue for immunohistochemical characterization\";\ncytology negative for malignant cells.\n\n# Diabetes: Required insulin drip temporarily for elevated blood\nglucose but transitioned back to ISS with glargine with good\ncontrol.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.\n\n# Communication: Patient.

She has a PICC and A\n   line at present.\n   Exam notable for obese WF Tm of 97 BP 150\/77 HR of 66 RR of 18 ( VT of\n   500 cc, PEEP of 16) with sats of 95% on  FiO2 of 90%. She has scant\n   wheezing but features of egophony on both sides. She has no edema.\n   Labs notable for WBC of 10 K, HCT of 29.9 , K+ 3.9 , Cr  0.9. recent\n   sputum cultures pos for MRSA.\n   CXR with diffuse bilateral ASD, cardiomegaly, scant effusions. Recent\n   PE protocol CT reviewed from OSH. There is no e\/o PE and lung fields\n   did not reveal such extensive ASD on [**2111-6-8**]\n   She has developed ARDS with rapid respiratory decline over past 72 hrs.\n   Possible etiologies include a viral illness complicated by MRSA,\n   atypical pathogens, fungal pneumonia etc. Her underlying immune status\n   is unclear but by report she does not bear HIV risk.\n   Agree with plan to use low VT strategy, high PEEP ( esophageal balloon)\n   to limit Tpp at end inspiration and exhalation. She will continue on\n   broad antibiotics and will benefit from bronch\/ BAL in for obtaining\n   respiratory secretions ( likely from RLL).

She\n   presented to OSH on [**2111-6-3**] with worsening dyspnea and had a fever to\n   103F, and was started on ceftriaxone\/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 6243**]) for\n   pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.  She developed an increasing oxygen\n   requirement, however, and initially required nasal canula (94% on 1 L\n   O2) but later required face mask (86% on 15 L on [**6-7**]).  Her CXR, which\n   initially was read as negative for infiltrate, progressively worsening,\n   with increasingly prominent diffuse bilateral infiltrates, right\n   greater than left.  She also had a negative chest CTA.  With an oxygen\n   requirement that was rising and worsening dyspnea, she was transitioned\n   to vanc\/zosyn\/levo and then vanc\/zosyn\/ceftaz ([**Date range (1) 6244**]; ceftaz\n   started [**6-8**]; levo on [**4-21**]) because of an allergy to\n   levofloxacin.  It is unclear why she received double coverage for gram\n   negatives.  She was also given methylprednisolone ([**6-6**] dose 20 mg iv\n   q8; then 80->60 mg iv q8 afterward).\n   On [**6-7**], she was admitted to the ICU and intubated electively for\n   hypoxia and SOB.  Sputum culture grew staph aureas that was MRSA per\n   report.  Influenza viral screen was negative.  Phenylephrine was\n   started because of hypotension to SBPs in the 80s after being intubated\n   and starting on propofol ([**Date range (1) 6244**]), which had to be uptitrated for\n   sedation.

As noted\n   above, she has a history of worsening dyspnea over the past few months\n   that has been treated with antibiotics and steroids.  She presented to\n   OSH on [**2111-6-3**] with worsening dyspnea and had a fever to 103F, and was\n   started on ceftriaxone\/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 6243**]) for pneumonia and COPD\n   exacerbation.  She developed an increasing oxygen requirement, however,\n   and initially required nasal canula (94% on 1 L O2) but later required\n   face mask (86% on 15 L on [**6-7**]).  Her CXR, which initially was read as\n   negative for infiltrate, progressively worsening, with increasingly\n   prominent diffuse bilateral infiltrates, right greater than left.  She\n   also had a negative chest CTA.  With an oxygen requirement that was\n   rising and worsening dyspnea, she was transitioned to vanc\/zosyn\/levo\n   and then vanc\/zosyn\/ceftaz ([**Date range (1) 6244**]; ceftaz started [**6-8**]; levo on\n   [**4-21**]) because of an allergy to levofloxacin.

Sputum culture grew staph aureas that was MRSA per\n   report.  Influenza viral screen was negative.  Phenylephrine was\n   started because of hypotension to SBPs in the 80s after being intubated\n   and starting on propofol ([**Date range (1) 6244**]), which had to be uptitrated for\n   sedation.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\n   stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the\n   aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\n   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the\n   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or\n   vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully\n   excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic\n   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.\n   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study).

They believe pt will have a trach\/peg placement in the next\n   couple of days and anticipate she will require at least several more\n   days of ICU level care.  Offered emotional support around the typical\n   stresses for family of a prolonged ICU stay.

Images were reconstructed\n in axial, coronal, sagittal, and oblique views.\n\n FINDINGS:  ET tube is in standard position.  The airways are patent to the\n segmental level.  There is no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary\n embolism. Diffuse extensive ground- glass opacity  partially spares the apex\n of the lungs. There is consolidation in the superior segment of the right\n lower lobe extending to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. Small\n areas of atelectasis are present in the bases of the lungs. There are no\n pleural effusions or pericardial effusion. Cardiac size is top normal. The\n aorta is normal in caliber. Prevascular and mediastinal lymph nodes measure up\n to 10 mm in the right lower paratracheal station. Bilateral hilar\n lymphadenopathy measures up to 10 mm on the right.  NG tube tip is out of view\n below the diaphragm.\n\n This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  The\n visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.\n\n Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.\n\n There are no bone findings of malignancy.\n\n IMPRESSION:  No evidence of PE.\n\n Consolidation in the posterior segment of right upper lobe and superior\n segment of right lower lobe likely aspiration pneumonia.\n\n Atelectasis is in the bases of the lungs.\n\n Given the fact that there is no cardiomegaly or pleural effusions, diffuse\n ground-glass opacity is probably not cardiogenic in origin.  Could be\n resolving noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or drug reaction\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2111-6-12**] 10:39 AM\n CTA CHEST W&W\/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY                          Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 77791**]\n Reason: please eval for possible PE and other pulmonary pathology\n Admitting Diagnosis: CHRONIC [**Last Name (un) **] PULM DISEASE; BILAT PNEUMONIA\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 100\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n Reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n\n\n\n\tRadiology: [**2111-6-13**] 8:14 AM\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 77792**]\n Reason: interval change\n Admitting Diagnosis: CHRONIC [**Last Name (un) **] PULM DISEASE; BILAT PNEUMONIA\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n  66 year old woman with ARDS now intubated.\n REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n  interval change\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with ARDS, now intubated, assess for interval\n change.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray dated [**2111-6-13**] at 9:29 a.m. was obtained.\n Comparison is made to a prior chest x-ray from [**2111-6-12**].\n\n FINDINGS:\n The patient is rotated to the right.

She says she\nhad no strength, and decided to lay down.  She had nausea for an\nhour and her Neighbor took her blood pressure which was 110\/90.\nConcomitantly she had a \"chest ache\" ([**9-18**]) with a dull L arm\nache.  Concerned for MI, she took asa 81 mg x 4.  Her pain was\nnon-radiating, non-exertional, and not relieved with rest.  She\nthen went to the ER for further evaluation.  She reports no\ndyspnea,  sick contacts, antecedent illness, long trips, or calf\npain.  She sees her PCP every four months.  On the floor she is\nchest pain free.  Her chest pain resolved after receiving\nmedications at [**Location (un) 620**] (lopressor, nitroglycerin, morphine).\n.\nOn review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,\nTIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the\ntime of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black\nstools or red stools. S\/he denies recent fevers, chills or\nrigors. S\/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Based upon her\nECG, ECHO and cardiac enzymes, the most likely diagnosis was\nprior distal LAD MI with recent onset myopericarditis.\n.\n# Chest Pain: Patient presented with chest pain, elevated\ncardiac enzymes, and diffuse ST elevations on EKG. Her chest\npain resolved prior to admission; she had no recurrent symptoms.\nHer cardiac catheterization, as described above, showed mild\ndisease but no occlusions and no intervention was necessary. She\nsubsequently had a cardiac MRI which showed enhanced gadolinium\nuptake (near-transmural) in a coronary distribution (mid LAD),\nsuggestive of an ischemic etiology for her apical hypokinesis\nseen on Echo; the pericardial effusion was stable. It was\nthought she had a prior distal LAD territory MI with recent\nmyopericarditis (enhancement of pericardium and inflammation of\nmyocardium on cardiac MR). Of note, the final read is not in OMR\nat time of discharge but was discussed between attendings. The\nfinal report will be sent to her new cardiologist.  She was\ndischarged on Aspirin 81 mg daily, statin, beta-blocker, and\nace-inhibitor. She was anticoagulated for prophylaxis of apical\nthrombus (and AF).\n\n# Atrial fibrilation: The patient developed afib with RVR 3 days\nafter admission and spontaneously converted to SR. This was\nthought to be due to local irritation secondary to\nmyopericarditis. She had an additional episode of RVR prior to\ndishcarge with conversion to SR after three doses of 5 mg IV\nlopressor.  She was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable\nduring these episodies.  She was discharged on Metoprolol\nSuccinate XL 75 mg daily as well as Warfarin 2.5 mg daily with\nclose follow-up of her INR.\n\n# Hypoxia: CXR showed pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension in the\nsetting of no history of lung disease. Patient was weaned from\nO2 to room air.  Her hypoxia was discussed with her PCP with\nplan for an outpatient work up of her disease.\n\n# VP Shunt: Following the patient's cardiac MRI, a skull x-ray\nshowed the shunt tip to be stable. Neurosurgery was consulted\nand the shunt was reprogrammed the day of the MRI.\n\n# HTN: BP remained stable throughout admission and was\nmaintained on Metoprolol and Enalapril. Patient discharged on\nMetoprolol as above and Enalapril Maleate 10 mg daily.\n\n# Cornea transplant, Left eye: Patient maintained on home\nPredforte throughout admission.\n\nPatient remained full code throughout admission.\n\nMedications on Admission:\npredforte L eye 1 drop evenings\nTylenol PM PRN insomnia\nProtonix 40 mg PO daily\nVasotex 10 mg PO daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

This showed an old heart attack and\nwe think that the chest pain was caused by inflammation of your\nheart muscle. This has resolved but we have adjusted your\nmedicines to prevent another heart attack. You should call Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 8051**] if you have any more chest pain.\n.\nYou also had a very fast irregular heart beat called atrial\nfibrillation. We started a long acting beta blocker, Metoprolol,\nto control your rhythm. Because atrial fibrillation increases\nyour risk of a stroke, coumadin was started with a goal INR or\n2.0-3.0. You need to have your INR checked on Friday at [**Hospital1 **]\n[**Location (un) 620**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8051**] will tell you how much coumadin to\ntake from now on.\n.\nPlease make the following changes to your medications:\n1. Start taking a baby aspirin to prevent another heart attack\n2. Start taking Metoprolol Succinate to keep your heart rhythm\nin normal sinus\n3. Start taking coumadin to prevent a stroke.\n4. Start taking Simvastatin to prevent and blockages in your\ncoronary arteries.\n.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nName: [**Last Name (STitle) **],[**Name8 (MD) 8055**] MD\nLocation: SUBURBAN CARDIOLOGY\nAddress: [**Location (un) 8056**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 8057**]\nPhone: [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 8058**]\nAppointment: Tuesday [**2108-11-20**] 11:45 am\n\n\n\n",

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and\ncavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction with hypo- to akinesis of the distal LV segments. The remaining\nsegments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size and\nfree wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending\nand arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmoderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a\ntrivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In absence of\nobstructive coronary artery disease, these findings are most compatible with\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy, although a distal LAD lesion may result in similar\nwall motion abnormalities.\n\n\n\tECG: Sinus rhythm. There are R waves in the inferior leads but with ST segment\nelevation. Q waves are present in leads V4-V6 with ST segment elevation and\nT wave inversions. Since the previous tracing R waves are more apparent in the\ninferior leads. Clinical correlation is suggested.\nTRACING #3\n\n\tECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Since the previous tracing\nthe rate is slower. Precordial leads are showing evolutionary change. Clinical\ncorrelation is suggested.\nTRACING #2\n\n\tECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Q waves with ST segment\nelevation in leads II, III and aVF and lateral leads. Consider inferolateral\nmyocardial infarction, probably acute. Low limb lead voltage. Since the\nprevious tracing of [**2108-11-11**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular\nresponse is new. Small R waves in the inferior leads are less prominent raising\nthe possibility that these changes could be pericardial, although ST segment\ndepression is not prominent in lead aVR. Clinical correlation is suggested.\nTRACING #1\n\n\tECG: Normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads V3-V6 suggestive of\nanterior ischemia.  Clinical correlation is suggested.  Compared to the\ntracing #2 the T wave abnormalities are new.\nTRACING #3\n\n\tECG: Normal sinus rhythm.  Compared to tracing #1 the ST segments in the anterior\nleads are no longer elevated.\nTRACING #2\n\n\tECG: Normal sinus rhythm with ST segment elevation in leads V3-V6 suggestive\nof possible anterior ischemia\/infarction.  Clinical correlation is suggested.\nNo previous tracing available for comparison.\nTRACING #1\n\n\tECG: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Minor ST segment elevation in the inferior\nleads. More prominent ST segment elevation in the lateral precordial leads with\nsmall Q waves and biphasic T waves. Since the previous tracing sinus rhythm is\nagain present. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent. Clinical correlation\nis suggested.\nTRACING #5\n\n\tECG: Regular narrow complex tachycardia. Possible atrial flutter\nwith 2:1 block. Since the previous tracing the rate has increased. Atrial\nmechanism has changed.

The pericardial thickness was\n normal without evidence of tethering on tagged images. There was a very small\n pericardial effusion. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The\n indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.\n The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.  The left\n atrial AP dimension was normal.  The right atrial length in the 4-chamber view\n was normal.  The left atrial length in the 4-chamber view was mildly\n increased. The coronary sinus diameter was normal.\n The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.  The end-\n diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated left ventricular ejection\n fraction was mildly depressed at 51% severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the\n distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, apex and distal\n inferior wall.  There was no clot seen in the left ventricle.  The\n anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal. The left\n ventricular mass index was normal.  The right ventricular end-diastolic volume\n index was normal.  The calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was\n normal at 56%, with normal free wall motion.\n The aortic valve was tri-leaflet. The aortic valve area was minimally reduced.\n A signal void was seen in the right atrium during systole consistent with\n tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2108-11-13**] 2:21 PM\n MR [**First Name (Titles) 3378**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13093**]\/FX P\/P CONTRAST; MR [**First Name (Titles) 3378**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3379**] FLOW MAP, ADD-ONClip # [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 51486**]\n Reason: PERICARDITIS\n Admitting Diagnosis: CATH\n  Contrast: MAGNEVIST Amt: 24\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n Quantitative Flow\n There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no\n significant aortic regurgitation.  The calculated mitral valve regurgitant\n fraction was consistent with moderate mitral regurgitation.   The resultant\n effective forward LVEF was moderately reduced at 38%. The right ventricular\n stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant pulmonic\n regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n Myocardial Perfusion and Fibrosis\n There was uniform resting perfusion of all visualized segments.  There was an\n area of transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the distal inferior wall and\n apex consistent with myocardial scarring\/infarction.  The pericardium showed\n late gadolinium enhancement, consistent with inflammation\/pericarditis.\n\n T2 Stir\n There was transmural signal enhancement seen in the apex and lateral wall,\n consistent with myocardial edema.\n\n Non-Cardiac Findings\n A note was made of bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions, left greater\n than right.  There is a 1 cm retrocaval pretracheal lymph node.  There is a\n liver cyst in segment 2 of the liver, measuring 3.2 cm and possibly smaller\n cysts in the right lobe of the liver.  There are thoracic and lumbar\n compression fractures, not fully evaluated on the current study.  The left\n lobe lobe and right lower lobe show pulmonary abmormalities, better evaluated\n on the recent chest X-ray.\n\n\n Impression:\n 1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with hypokinesis to akinesis of the\n distal anterior wall, distal inferior wall and apex.  The LVEF was mildly\n depressed at 51%. The effective forward LVEF was moderately depressed at 38%.\n There was CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring\/infarction in the apex and\n distal inferior wall, in a mid-LAD distribution.  No evidence of left apical\n thrombus seen.\n 2. Late gadolinium enhancement of the pericardium, consistent with\n pericarditis.  Very small pericardial effusion.\n 3. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. The RVEF was\n normal at 56%.\n 4. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.\n 5. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were\n normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter index was normal.\n 6. Mild left atrial enlargement.\n 7.
